1. Add key handling
	- Look in the Hero.js 'move' function
	- Hint: this.keys: left, right, up, down
	- Example: this.keys[left]
	- Update this.x and this.y using this.speed

2. Add blood splatter
	- Look in the Game.js 'draw' function
	- Hint: this.images: background, villain, monster, hero, dead
	- Example: this.images.background
	- Look at how the other images are drawn above it.

3. Change the images
	- Look in Const.js for any IMAGE values, and then change it with another image in the images folder.
